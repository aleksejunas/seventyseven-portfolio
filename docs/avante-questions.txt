1. Access your Sanity Studio at `http://localhost:3333/studio`
2. Create and edit your content models
3. Manage your content through the Sanity interface

Since it's working, you can now:
- Create and edit your content types in the schemas directory
- Use the Studio interface to add and manage content
- Connect your frontend React components to fetch data from Sanity

Would you like help with any specific aspect of using Sanity Studio, such as:
1. Creating content models/schemas?
2. Setting up the desk structure?
3. Configuring the Studio layout?
4. Connecting your frontend to Sanity?

2. You can now import and use the `useSanityQuery` hook in any component to fetch data from Sanity.

3. Use the `urlFor` helper function to build image URLs from Sanity image references.

Example GROQ queries you can use:
```typescript
// Fetch all photos
*[_type == "photo"]

// Fetch specific photo by ID
*[_type == "photo" && _id == $id][0]

// Fetch photos with specific tag
*[_type == "photo" && references($tagId)]

// Fetch photos with related data
*[_type == "photo"]{
  _id,
  title,
  image,
  "tags": tags[]->{ title }
}
```

Would you like me to:
1. Show you how to set up more complex queries?
2. Add error boundaries and loading states?
3. Set up TypeScript types for your Sanity schema?
4. Add real-time subscription support?
